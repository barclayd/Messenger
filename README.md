### How to Setup

Please ensure that Progres is set up on your machine and a database named $user exists.

If you are starting from scratch, follow these steps to set up Postgres, replacing your user name within ``<user>``:

### MacOS

```shell script

brew doctor
brew update
brew install postgresql
ln -sfv /usr/local/opt/postgresql/*.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents
alias pg_start="launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.postgresql.plist"
alias pg_stop="launchctl unload ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.postgresql.plist"
pg_start
createdb <user>
```

To verify you have Postgres installed correctly, running the following command:

```shell script
psql
```

should look similar to:

```shell script
$ psql
psql (11.5)
Type "help" for help.

<user>=# 
```

```
$ git clone https://github.com/barclayd/Slack-Clone.git
$ cd server
$ npm run setup
$ cd .. && cd client
$ npm run start
```
### How to Run

```
$ git clone https://github.com/barclayd/Slack-Clone.git
$ cd server
$ npm run start
$ cd .. && cd client
$ npm run start
```
